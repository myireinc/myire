# MyIRE - My Integrated Research Environment

MyIRE was created to become a public utility for scientific integrity: an interoperable, end-to-end solution for reproducible research.

The goal of MyIRE is to enable anyone, anywhere to reproduce entire studies at any scale with the click of a button while facilitating the highest standards for privacy, security, and compliance.

MyIRE includes a cross platform GUI, scientific API abstraction layer, and services which facilitate data storage capable of exascale processing.

These services can be run in a completely distributed fashion, on premise, or across clouds.
